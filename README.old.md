mah-eval
========

Evaluates a mahjong hand.


## Usage

The program will read a line from standard input and attempt to parse it.
If it succeeds, a short summary of the hand is printed.
If it fails, "Error." is printed and the program will exit.


### Hand format

The basic format is a follows:

	<prevalent wind> <seat wind> (dora tiles) [(ura dora tiles)] tsumo|ron <tiles>

The final tile specified is taken to be the winning tile.
	
If ura dora tiles are listed, it is assumed the winning player declared riichi.
	
Open sets are specified as follows:

	(C C C)        ; Open pon of red dragons
	(P1 P2 P3)     ; Open chi, 1-2-3 of circles

Closed kans work similarly:

	[F F F F]      ; Closed kan of green dragons
	
Note that aside from kans, there is no need to specify closed sets.


### Examples

East round, west wins by self-draw. Open hand with a pon of dragons as the only yaku.

The tiles in examples are ordered for clarity, but they can be in any order as long as
the winning tile is given last. The above hand could also be given as follows:
